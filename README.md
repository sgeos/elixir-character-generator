# CharacterGenerator

Traveller inspired character generator written in elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add character_generator to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:character_generator, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure character_generator is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:character_generator]]
        end
